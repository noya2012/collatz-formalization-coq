(* Main theorem: Proof that in a k-step sequence, the number of R0 operations is exactly k, 
   then the number of R1 operations does not exceed k, and the total length does not exceed 2k.
   This shows that R0 operations (n/2) dominate in the sequence, supporting the intuition 
   that the sequence will eventually converge. *)
